Cramio is a study assistant website that uses the firebase platfrom by google to allow users to create flashcards and groups them by subject.
Users can go into which subject they would like to study and activate study mode. This mode cycles through the flashcards in a random order and allows the user to answer the questions.
The website will keep track of how many questions the user gets correct or wrong and displays a summary at the end of a study session. 

Flashcards and Entire subject categories can be:
